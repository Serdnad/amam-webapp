	<Card>
		<h1>Market</h1>

		<p>(andres still has to do)</p>

			I wonder if we can tweak the design to show a lot more info in the cards. at the very least,
			it's unclear what timeframe the charts show, but just adding (24hr) next to Change should
			probably do it.

			Besides that though, might be worth making each card bigger, condensing the text portion a
			bit, and maybe? adding a tick or two to the card
